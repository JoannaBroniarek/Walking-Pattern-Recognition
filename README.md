## Abstract

Classification is a fascinating world, full of things to discover and much more interesting if we can analyse
data generated by ourselves.

We have heard that as human beings we are unique, but...Will it be possible that these differences can be
detected even by a simple cell phone sensor, administered by an application designed to help young people
make better science school projects?

Our interest is to test if we are able to classify the way of walking of each one of the members of this group,
this would mean that each one of us has a unique and special way of walking and that alone would be an
interesting result.

Looking more towards the future, we think that this humble project can be the first motivation for an
advanced development in the realization of robots of each one of us, that are not only able to walk like us,
but to impersonate us whenever it is necessary.
